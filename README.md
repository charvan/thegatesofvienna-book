# What?

The Gates of Vienna is an interactive, non-linear comedy about the 1683. You read that correctly. I went through a lot to make it an app because, well, that was what you did in 2016/2017 when it was the number 1 siege comedy of the year. This, assuming you have an iPhone, you can still download <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1148627749">here on the App Store</a>.

What I'm trying to do now is reinvigorate it, or perhaps give it a last go and do the thing I should have probably done to begin with, which is put it on the web, and then see what experimenting I can do with it on an open, mobile platform.
