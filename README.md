# What?

The Gates of Vienna is an interactive, non-linear comedy about the 1683. You read that correctly. I went through a lot to make it an app because, well, that was what you did in 2016/2017 when it was the number 1 siege comedy of the year. That app is now about as dead and gone as everyone who was around in 1683.

What I'm trying to do now is reinvigorate it, or perhaps give it a last go and do the thing I should have probably done to begin with, which is put it on the web, and then see what experimenting I can do with it on an open, mobile platform.
