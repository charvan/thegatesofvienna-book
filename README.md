# Read the Book

[You can read the story here](https://jkosem.github.io/thegatesofvienna-book/).

It's supposed to be on a phone. Through the miracle of somehow resurrecting severely outdated, albeit working front-end skills, it's responsive so you can just read in a regular browser as well.

This link you also have up there in the right hand corner of this repo page of course.

# What?

The Gates of Vienna is an interactive, non-linear comedy about the 1683 Siege of Vienna.

You read that correctly. It's a comedy about a 17th century siege. At one point I read the excellent book [Enemy at the Gates](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2768797-the-enemy-at-the-gate) and of course thought immediately about all the comedy that can ensue when people are doing a lot of sitting around getting dysentery when they're not shooting cannons at each other. This came on the back of reading the entirety of the [Songs of Fire and Ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire) series and thinking a lot about story worlds and how they should be read. Thus, we now have The Gates of Vienna.

# Why?

I went through a lot to make it an app because, well, that was what you did in 2016/2017 when it was the Number 1 Siege Comedy of the Year. That app is now about as dead and gone as everyone who was around in 1683.

What I'm trying to do now is reinvigorate it, or perhaps give it a last go and do the thing I should have probably done to begin with, which is put it on the web, and then see what experimenting I can do with it on an open, mobile platform.

# "Roadmap"

Amongst the other million ideas I have had for this, I'm interested in milder but still object-oriented and choose your own way to read things. I'm working on the ePub/Kindle version of the whole book and by Point of View, but have also been thinking about ideally where the author can choose how or even how much they want to read, for instance only Murad and Katrina, and then how to read it, for instance chronologically or by place.
